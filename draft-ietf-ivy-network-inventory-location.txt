            A YANG Data Model for Network Inventory Location
            draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-location-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for Network Inventory
   location (e.g., site, room, rack, geo-location data), which provides
   location information with different granularity levels for
   inventoried network elements.

   Accurate location information is useful for network planning,
   deployment, and maintenance.  However, such information cannot be
   obtained or verified from the Network Elements themselves.  This
   document defines a location model for network inventory that extends
   the base inventory with comprehensive location data.

1.  Introduction

   NEs can be grouped by location to provide more information for
   network planning, deployment, and maintenance (e.g., easily locate
   problematic NEs, optimize network resources, or help planning
   forecasts).  The location can reflect outdoor or indoor information.
   An indoor location may be represented as a building, room, or other
   similar organizational structures.  Outdoor locations can be walls,
   poles, or other mount places.

   The information about sites, equipment rooms, and other more precise
   locations is critical, but it cannot be automatically populated and
   retrieved from network elements (NEs).  Instead, it is usually
   configured manually.

   The Network Inventory location model is to record physical locations,
   such as sites, building, equipment rooms, racks, and so on.
   Additionally, it includes provisions for physical addresses or geo-
   location data (geographic coordinates).  The location model can
   extend the base network inventory
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] to enrich NEs with location
   information.

   The Network Inventory location model is classified as a network
   configuration model (Section 4 of [RFC8309]).

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Hierarchical Locations of Network Inventory

   The "location" list is generalized to support a variety of geographic
   location, such as sites, rooms, buildings.

   A site represents a general geographic location to group a set of NEs
   and corresponding inventory components.  NEs, racks, equipment rooms,
   and buildings can be grouped within a site.

   A room is a facility, a space for network elements and other
   equipment (such as servers, storage) with power supply systems, air
   conditioning system, etc.

   Locations can be nested to form a hierarchy.  For example, buildings
   may be within a site, and a room may be within a building.

   The "location-type" is defined as a YANG identity to identify the
   type of an inventory location, which may be site, equipment room,
   building, etc.

           |        ...

3.  Rack

   "racks" represent physical equipment racks in which NEs can be
   installed, which facilitate device maintenance.  Through "rack-
   location", each rack can be assigned to a site or a specific location
   within a site, such as an equipment room.

   Each rack is assigned a unique ID and a name in the context of a
   facility, e.g. a site.  A rack may have some specific attributes,
   such as appearance-related attributes and electricity-related
   attributes.  The height, depth and width are described by Figure 2
   (please consider that the door of the rack is facing the user).

   Note: Further discussion is needed to decide whether to separate
   "racks" from the list of "location".

6.  Security Considerations

   This section uses the template described in Section 3.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   Specifically, the following subtrees and data nodes have particular
   sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   'locations': The list may be used to track the set of network
   elements.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ni-location
   Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry group:

   Name:  ietf-network-inventory-topology
   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ni-location
   Prefix:  nil
   Maintained by IANA?  N
   Reference:  RFC XXXX

Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank the authors and contributors of
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-network-inventory-yang] to trigger this work.  During
   the discussion of base Network Inventory (NI) model, it is agreed
   that the definition of the equipment room and rack can be a separate
   location model and support manual configuration, while the NI model
   aggregates the inventory data of the Network Elements (NEs) on the
   network.  Usually the information about sites or equipment rooms is
   not detectable by network controller and configured manually.

   The authors wish to thank Mohamed Boucadair and many others for their
   helpful comments and suggestions.
