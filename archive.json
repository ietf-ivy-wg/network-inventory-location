Here are some quick additional comments:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   NIT\r\n\r\nOLD:\r\n\r\nThe location model can  extend the base network inventory\r\n\r\n   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] to enrich NEs with location\r\n\r\n   information.\r\n\r\nNEW:\r\n\r\nThe location model augments\r\n\r\n   the base network inventory\r\n\r\n   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] to enrich NEs with location\r\n\r\n   information.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   NIT\r\n\r\nOLD:\r\n\r\n   The Network Inventory location model is classified as a network\r\n\r\n   configuration model (Section 4 of [RFC8309]).\r\n\r\nNEW:\r\n\r\n   The Network Inventory location model is classified as a network\r\n\r\n   model (Section 3.5.1 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis]).\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Question:\r\n\r\nCURRENT:\r\n\r\n   The Network Inventory location YANG model conforms to the Network\r\n\r\n   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].\r\n\r\nPer the IETF guidelines, new models should comply with 8342. What is actually important to highlight is the following:\r\n\r\n\"Designers SHOULD describe and justify any NMDA exceptions in detail, such as the use of separate subtrees and/or separate leafs.\"\r\n\r\nI guess this can be revisited once the module is stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Clarification (many occurrences): not sure how these two are related?
