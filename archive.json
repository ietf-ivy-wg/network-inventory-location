What is actually important to highlight is the following:\r\n\r\n\"Designers SHOULD describe and justify any NMDA exceptions in detail, such as the use of separate subtrees and/or separate leafs.\"\r\n\r\nI guess this can be revisited once the module is stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Clarification (many occurrences): not sure how these two are related?
